# TDD Basic Example

This project shows a basic TDD example with some of the most common annotations.

This project used Java and Maven.

We have to declare the maven-surefire-plugin in the pom.xml file and configure the dependencies of this plugin. 

We have to declare the following dependencies:

The junit-platform-surefire-provider dependency allows us to run tests that use either the “old” JUnit (3 or 4) or JUnit 5.

If we want to run tests that use either JUnit 3 or 4, we have to declare the junit-vintage-engine dependency.

If we want to run tests that use JUnit 5, we have to declare the junit-jupiter-engine dependency.

## Maven goals
### Run the unit tests
```
mvn clean test
```

### Generate javadoc for the source code
```
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

### Generate javadoc for the test code
```
mvn javadoc:test-javadoc
```

### Generate Jacoco source code coverage report
```
mvn test jacoco:report
```

### Check if thresholds limits are achieved
```
mvn test jacoco:check
```

### Generates a PIT Mutation coverage report to target/pit-reports/YYYYMMDDHHMI
```
mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
```

### Generates a quicker PIT Mutation coverage report to target/pit-reports/YYYYMMDDHHMI
```
mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -DwithHistory
```

### Complete example

``` 
mvn test jacoco:report org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -DhistoryInputFile=target/fasterPitMutationTesting-history.txt -DhistoryOutputFile=target/fasterPitMutationTesting-history.txt -Dsonar.pitest.mode=reuseReport -Dthreads=4 -DtimestampedReports=false
```
## Jacoco dependencies
* https://github.com/pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin
  - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin
    - required to work with JUnit5

#Final Project 

For my final Project I will set up a new Project that I might want to work further on later, once I have more time. 
The goal of this Project is to have a "Track Keeping System for pet-food and feeding time", so that one can for example share the
information with pet-sitters, but also keep track of medicine or special diet needs of a pet. 

### What I hope to do: 
1. try to work object oriented
2. work with teh TDD approach 
3. have at least 3 tested methods 

##Test Thoughts and Cases
The minimum requriement for my Program in the beginning will be that the Name and the Diet is set, all the other extra information
is not going to be a requirement. 

- [] Test Case 1: make sure I can add a Pet to the List of my Pets
